const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is the minimum order quantity (MOQ)?",
    a: "We start with a sample kit of 2 bottles for you to test with your team. After that, our minimum order is just 6 bottles — designed to be low-risk for pilot programs."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the shelf life of KIN Syrup?",
    a: "Sealed, KIN lasts 6+ months at room temperature. Once opened, refrigerate and use within 30 days for optimal freshness. The concentrated format means less waste compared to RTD alternatives."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you deliver outside of Delhi/NCR?",
    a: "We currently deliver across major metros in India — Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. We're expanding rapidly. Reach out and we'll confirm availability for your city."
  },
  {
    q: "What if my bartenders don't know how to use it?",
    a: "We provide a complete onboarding kit — recipe cards, a mixing guide, and video tutorials. We can also arrange a virtual training session for your bar team at no extra cost."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I customize the dilution ratio for my venue?",
    a: "Absolutely. The 1:3 ratio is our recommendation, but many of our partners adjust it to suit their signature drinks. Stronger for cocktails, lighter for mocktails — it's designed to be flexible."
  },
  {
    q: "Is KIN certified? Do you have FSSAI approval?",
    a: "We are currently in the process of obtaining FSSAI certification. KIN is made with 100% natural ingredients — Shiitake, Ginger, Lemon, and other functional botanicals — with no artificial additives or preservatives."
  },
  {
    q: "What makes KIN different from regular syrups?",
    a: "KIN is not a flavoring syrup — it's a functional botanical elixir. Each ingredient is chosen for its functional properties: Shiitake for cognitive support, Ginger for digestive warmth, and Lemon for vitality. It's a drink in itself, not just an ingredient."
